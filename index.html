        <p>the title of my piece is "mr. heartman". i chose this title because i was attempting to create a heart shape with my brass rod, 
            but ultimately ended up playing with the rod too much to the point where the rod was genuinely unsalvagable. but rather 
            than feel disappointed, i decided to embrace the awkward lines and unbendable rod and make the heart 
            some shoes. i wanted this piece to reflect the love i have for my friends and my family (hence the awkwardly placed trinkets). 
            however, by the end of the soldering process (my very first soldering project by the way), i want it to also represent the love 
            i have for learning. learning how to solder reminded me that learning does not stop when you become a senior and secure a full-time job,
            but that learning will always be a constant love in my life. so, hopefully mr. heartman will become the start of many paths of love for me! 
            (btw: i hope you enjoy the mini photoshoot i had for him, i really tried bringing out whatever artistry i had left in me) </p>

        <h4>creative vision °❀⋆.ೃ࿔* </h4>
        <p>the title of my second piece is ‘wandering’! i chose this title for a few reasons – the first one being that the shape of my piece is a 
            cloud (i guess clouds wander in the sky?). i was looking out the window after class last thursday (2/5/26) and thought it would be a 
            perfect shape for one of my first ever art pieces in the class. at the beginning of this project, i wanted this piece to represent the 
            fact that my interests are allowed to wander in life, whether in art or computer science. 

            however, by the end of the project, i think the name ‘wandering’ took on a different meaning. this piece let me wander through the joys and pains of 
            trying things for the first time, including making mistakes and accepting them. for example, there is a small glob of solder to the left of my battery 
            from when i tried (and failed) using a solder sucker for the first time. when this happened, i was legitimately heartbroken. i felt like my project 
            was so ugly (lol) and that i failed at perfecting it first try. after getting over my initial (dramatic) emotions, i decided to look at my glob as 
            proof of my immense effort to get my project to work. it symbolized the frustrating hour and a half it took to solder the battery holder and everything 
            else (just for the holder to fall right off). i let go of the notion that a scratchless, solder-less board was the goal of the project, and decided to 
            leap right in and sandpaper the entire thing (hence the massive scratches all over). to me, this project reminds me of how effort is more important 
            than perfection (very corny i know), and that all that matters is that im finally starting to create something new!! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶
