    <p>the title of my piece is "mr. heartman". i chose this title because i was attempting to create a heart shape with my brass rod, 
        but ultimately ended up playing with the rod too much to the point where the rod was genuinely unsalvagable. but rather 
        than feel disappointed, i decided to embrace the awkward lines and unbendable rod and make the heart 
        some shoes. i wanted this piece to reflect the love i have for my friends and my family (hence the awkwardly placed trinkets). 
        however, by the end of the soldering process (my very first soldering project by the way), i want it to also represent the love 
        i have for learning. learning how to solder reminded me that learning does not stop when you become a senior and secure a full-time job,
        but that learning will always be a constant love in my life. so, hopefully mr. heartman will become the start of many paths of love for me! 
        (btw: i hope you enjoy the mini photoshoot i had for him, i really tried bringing out whatever artistry i had left in me) </p>
